###### TODO LIST #######

- Some cleanup of the code has to be done. There are useless comments here and there, and some weird syntax hanging around
- Check the MPI IO issue -- Bad performance with multiple processes...
- Drop in the code that allows compiling without --open64
- Check for memory leaks (things not being deallocated correctly)
