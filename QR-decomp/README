QR Decomposition

o Performs the in-place QR decomposition of a batch of matrices, using Givens rotations.

o Three approaches are considered and are included in the different files "giv_qr_*"
- Giv_qr_bat: . The Givens rotations are accumulated through a GEMM routine from CUBLAS.
- Giv_qr_mmpbl: functions the same way as giv_qr_bat, but each CUDA Block now deals with multiple matrices, thus improving the occupancy for small matrices
- Giv_qr_kuck: performs the QR decomposition with multiple independent Givens rotations being applied to the matrix at the same time.

o Timers are included to measure the performance against MKL

o To build on lion-GA:
> module load cuda/5.0
> module load mkl
> make

o A makefile is also provided to build on Stampede. To build on Stampede:
> module load cuda/5.0
> module spider mkl
> make -f Makefile_stampede
