{"name":"Lion-codes","tagline":"GPU research and teaching applications","body":"This project consists of GPU research and teaching codes, with specific applications contained in individual directories of the main repository. These applications cover many domains including chemical kinetics, condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry to name several. Key algorithms include Newton-Raphson using GMRES, Lanczos eigen-decomposition, QR and LU algorithms, as well as transforms (eg., Radon) and elementary numerical building blocks like random number generation and integration.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of dependencies including Boost, Thrust, CUSP/CUSPARSE, CUBLAS, and OpenCV to name several, as noted in individual makefiles, with paths generally suited to the lion-GA RCC cluster at Penn State.\r\n\r\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure (RCC) Unit at Penn State, Jason Holmes, hardware donations of Tesla devices from Hewlett Packard and Nvidia, the Nvidia CUDA Research Center Program, as well as computational time available through XSEDE on TACC Stampede.
